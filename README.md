Security System for Mobile Voting with Biometrics

For development of mobile application Iâ€™ve used Android Studio IDE and Android SDK
tools. Development of the Server Side was done in Eclipse using Jersey API for communication between client and server.
The biometric part was implemented using OpenCV and connection with the server database was made using JDBC.
